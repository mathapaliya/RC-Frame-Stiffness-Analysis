Dynamic Modal Analysis of 6-Storey RC Frame
This repository contains a Python-based implementation for performing dynamic modal analysis on a 6-storey reinforced concrete (RC) frame using shear-type behavior assumptions. The script computes natural frequencies, mode shapes, modal participation, modal displacements, inter-storey drifts, and equivalent static forces using both SRSS and CQC methods. All results are visualized using matplotlib.

üßÆ Model Summary
Number of storeys: 6

Floor height (uniform): 3.2 m

System: Shear-type multi-storey RC frame (no rotational DOFs)

Degrees of freedom: 6 translational DOFs (1 per floor level)

Modal analysis type: Linear undamped free vibration (eigenvalue problem)

Mode combination methods: SRSS and CQC

üßæ Mass and Stiffness Input
The mass matrix (M) and stiffness matrix (K) have been pre-computed externally (based on building geometry, material properties, tributary areas, and member dimensions).

These matrices are directly inserted into the script.

Units:

Mass: kg (implicitly; via kN/g conversion if applicable)

Stiffness: N/m

numpy

scipy

matplotlib



üìä Output Summary
Natural frequencies (œâ‚Çô) and time periods (T‚Çô)

Mode shapes normalized to max displacement

Modal displacements (in mm)

Inter-storey drift diagrams

Modal participation factors (œÑ‚Çô)

üìò Notes
The script assumes no torsional modes (pure shear type lateral displacement only).

The height of each storey is 3.2 meters.

You may edit the mass or stiffness matrices to model other building configurations.

Visualization blocks (e.g., for plotting) are organized by response type.
